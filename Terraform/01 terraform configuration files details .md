## Terraform configuration files details-
-certain files are created and used during the execution of Terraform commands-
- `.terraform Directory`
- `.terraform.lock.hcl`
- `.terraform.tfstate`

### - `.terraform directory`-
The `.terraform` directory is automatically created by Terraform when you initialize a working directory using terraform init-
- Provider Plugins: When you run terraform init, Terraform downloads the necessary provider plugins (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and stores them in the .terraform directory. These plugins allow Terraform to interact with various cloud providers and APIs.
- Module Downloads: If your configuration uses modules (either local or from the Terraform Registry), Terraform will download and store those module files inside the .terraform directory as well.


### - `.terraform.lock.hcl`-
- The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is automatically generated by Terraform when you run terraform init. It is a lock file that records the exact versions of the provider plugins used in your configuration. The purpose of this file is to ensure consistency across different environments and to prevent unexpected changes in behavior when running Terraform across multiple machines or environments.



.terraform	Contains internal files, including provider plugins and module downloads (not for versioning).
.terraform.lock.hcl	Locks provider versions to ensure consistent versions are used across environments.
terraform.tfstate	Tracks the current state of your infrastructure (e.g., resources, their configurations, and IDs).
